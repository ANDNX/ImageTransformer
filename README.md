# 🖼️ Image Transfer Website using Encoders

This project is a web-based application that allows users to upload and transfer high-quality images using encoder-based techniques. The primary goal is to **preserve image quality** during transmission, leveraging deep learning encoders for efficient image representation and reconstruction.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload and transfer images via the web interface
- Encoder-decoder architecture to compress and reconstruct images
- Maintains high visual fidelity after transfer
- Supports multiple image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG)
- Responsive and user-friendly UI

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Image Upload:** The user selects an image to upload.
2. **Encoding:** The image is passed through a trained encoder that compresses it into a lower-dimensional latent representation.
3. **Transmission:** The compressed representation is transferred over the network.
4. **Decoding:** A decoder reconstructs the image from the encoded data on the receiver side.
5. **Display:** The high-quality image is displayed with minimal loss.
